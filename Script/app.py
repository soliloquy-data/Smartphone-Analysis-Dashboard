    Welcome to the **Smartphone Data Analysis & Dashboard!** This platform offers deep insights into a dataset of smartphones sourced from **[Smartprix](https://www.smartprix.com/mobiles)**, a leading website for smartphone comparisons. The dataset spans from **2014 to November 2024**, showcasing a wide variety of smartphones across different brands, models, and key features.

    ### Data Filtering Criteria
    To ensure quality and relevance, only smartphones with at least a **processor** and **1GB of RAM** are considered, resulting in a refined dataset of **3556 smartphones**.

    ### Analysis Sections
    1. **Overall Analysis**: This section provides a comprehensive look at the entire dataset, focusing on key trends, brand performance, and feature distributions. Users can explore visualizations that highlight market dynamics, brand popularity, and technological advancements over the years. It's ideal for understanding the broader smartphone market and tracking industry shifts.

    2. **User-Centric Data Analysis**: Designed with potential buyers in mind, this section emphasizes key features that matter most to consumers, such as **price range**, **camera quality**, and **battery life**.
    - **Phone Age**: For a more relevant analysis, only smartphones launched after **October 2021** are included. Additionally, we account for the varying durations of software support across brands:
    - **Apple** devices typically receive **5+ years of support**, **High-end Samsung** models receive **3-4 years** of support.
    - **Budget Android brands** like **Xiaomi** and **Realme** may have shorter support windows.
    - **Season of Release**: Smartphones launched in the **Q4 (October‚ÄìDecember)** are prioritized for their longer market relevance, as these models often benefit from the holiday season sales and extended shelf life.
       
    As a result of these filters, **1262 smartphones** are considered in the User-Centric Analysis, reflecting the most relevant options for today's buyers.

    üëâ **Use the sidebar navigation** to explore different analysis sections and filter the data based on your preferences. The app is designed to help you discover key insights about the smartphone market.

    ### Data Source
    The data used in this app comes from **Smartprix**, which aggregates smartphone specifications, pricing, and reviews from various sources. Only smartphones meeting the criteria outlined above have been included in the analysis, ensuring the data‚Äôs relevance and quality.

    All insights presented are derived from publicly available information, providing users with a clear view of the current smartphone landscape.


    ### Purpose Statement

    The **Smartphone Data Analysis & Dashboard** serves as a comprehensive exploration of the smartphone market, designed to showcase my skills in **data analysis**, **data cleaning**, and **presentation**, while highlighting my curiosity and ability to learn new tools.

    By using **Streamlit**, I built an interactive dashboard, opting for it over traditional tools like Power BI or Tableau. This allowed me to create a custom visualization that reflects my **analytical approach** and demonstrates my ability to build user-friendly, data-driven solutions.
